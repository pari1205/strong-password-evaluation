| Sunshine123     | Very Weak    | 0.02 seconds  | Common password with predictable pattern. No special characters used.            |
| BinDiy@#        | Medium       | 3 days        | Better complexity with symbols, but short in length and lacks numbers.           |
| S#nshine@2024   | Very Strong  | 379 years     | Strong use of symbols, upper/lower case, numbers, and sufficient length.         |

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Best Practices

- **Password length matters**: Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
- **Use complexity**: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Avoid dictionary words**: Common words or names are easily guessed in dictionary attacks.
- **Don’t use personal info**: Like birthdays or names, which are easily guessed.
- **Use passphrases**: Example: `R@inyD@y$In2024!` is easier to remember and strong.
- **Don't reuse passwords** across accounts.
- Use **password managers** to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

## 🔍 Common Password Attacks

### 1. Brute Force Attack
Tries every possible combination of characters. Short and simple passwords are cracked quickly.

### 2. Dictionary Attack
Uses a list of common passwords and words. Passwords like `sunshine123` are highly vulnerable.

### 3. Phishing Attack
Tricks users into entering their passwords on fake websites or apps. This bypasses password strength entirely.

### 4. Credential Stuffing
Hackers use previously leaked username-password pairs from data breaches to gain access to other accounts where the same password was reused.

### 5. Keylogging
Malware records keystrokes on your device, capturing your password as you type it.

## 📊 How Password Complexity Affects Security

- **Simple passwords** are cracked in seconds using automated tools.
- **Complex passwords** with sufficient length (12+ characters) and mixed character types drastically increase the time and effort required to crack them.
- Example: Adding just one special character or number increases security significantly.
